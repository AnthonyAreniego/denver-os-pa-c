## Operating Systems Concepts: Programming Assignment 1

_dynamic memory management with the C language_

* * *

### Goals

1. Practice development in the C programming language.
2. Learn to manage (allocate/deallocate) dynamic memory (aka memory on the heap/free store).
3. Get a feel for the memory management overhead in an operating system.
4. Get a basic understanding of the operation of `malloc` and the heap.
5. Practice working with a variety of data structures.
6. Practice programming with pointers.
7. Prepare for the development of the [Pintos](http://pintos-os.org/) projects.
8. Develop good coding style.

### Synopsis

PA1 asks you to implement a memory pool manager which allocates dynamic memory blocks from a set pre-allocated region, mimicking the functionality of the C Standard Library function `malloc()`. You are given a header file `mem_pool.h` and a source file `mem_pool.c`. You are not supposed to change the header file and are free to use the infrastructure in the source file to implement the user-facing functions in the header, or come up with your own.

PA1 is an assignment in the test-driven development (TDD) style. The provided `main.c` driver file executes a suite of unit tests against your implementation, and your score is equal to the ratio of the number of successfully passed tests and the total number of tests. The tests use the [cmocka](https://cmocka.org/) unit test framework.
